# League of Legends Auto-Minimizer

## Overview

**League of Legends Auto-Minimizer** is a background utility designed to enhance your gaming experience by automatically minimizing the League of Legends client when it opens without user interaction. This program is particularly useful if you want to keep the League of Legends client minimized to prevent accidental disruptions while you are focused on other tasks.
**USE IT ONLY ON YOUR OWN RISK!!!!**

## Features

- **System Tray Integration**: Runs in the system tray for easy access and control.
- **Administrator Privileges Required**: Must be run with administrator rights to ensure proper functionality.
- **Enable/Disable Functionality**: You can easily enable or disable the program through the system tray icon.
- **Automatic Minimization**: Automatically minimizes the League of Legends client if it opens without user interaction.
- **User Interaction Detection**: Allows the client to be opened or interacted with normally by clicking or using Alt+Tab.

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: The program continuously monitors whether the League of Legends client is running.
2. **Sleep Mode**: If the League of Legends client is not running, the program goes into sleep mode to conserve resources.
3. **Client Running**: When the League of Legends client is detected, the program activates and begins monitoring.
4. **Game vs. Client**: If the League of Legends game (not the client) is running, the program enters sleep mode.
5. **Interaction Check**: Every 0.1 seconds, the program checks if the League of Legends client is minimized or if the user has interacted with it.
6. **Minimization**: If the client is not minimized and not interacted with by the user, it will be automatically minimized.
